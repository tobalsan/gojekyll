# Here is your first Jekyll post

This a sample post provided by default for example purpose

`Actually, it's pretty cool to be able to write posts in markdown`.
Like this you can easily:

- Make lists
- Like
- This

But you also can **put things in bold** or in *italics*.

And further, you can easily make code:

> Indent text

Or use github flavored syntax highlighting and fenced code blocks

```html
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html lang="en-US">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Test</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p>test</p>
</body>
</html>
```

    And another block of code
    <div>
        Simple code block
    </div>
