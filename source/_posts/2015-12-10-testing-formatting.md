Okay this is a test

How does markdown works here ? Let's see.

## Here is a h2

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Provident aperiam ipsam fugit itaque illum suscipit vitae esse dicta sed, inventore nam dignissimos commodi consequatur, asperiores quasi aut, maxime expedita vel.

Now, a quote:

> Hello people :)
> How are you today ?

Now let's try some lists:

  - this
  - is
  - an
  - unoredered
  - list


And even this:

  1. A list
  2. With
  3. Numbers

_This is italic text_ and this is **bold text**.
I wonder if `code text works`. Ok, now let's test [links](http://www.example.com), and even images:
![This is an image](/img/post-bg-06.jpg)

    <div>this is supposed to be code</div> 

And now, does GFM fenced code blocks work ?

```php
<?php
function test($var)
{
    echo 'Yes !';
}
```
